# About the Project
**Title**: ``Improve available classifiers through data augmention using generative AI``  
At the Chair of Information & Market Engineering (IISM) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

Development of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to synthetically create realistic EEG data (multivariate time series). 
As for the data we used 10 sessions of one field study participant solving difficult math task, while 7 channels were
attached to his/her brain to collect EEG data. During the field study we surveyed the mental workload that serves as
our class labels (for the EEGNet). In this seminar, we have shown that by populating the training set *X_train* with
synthetical / reconstructed data from the VAE, it stabilizes the training and decreases the validation loss and also 
increases the validation accuracy (see figures below).

# Setting up the environment and run the code
Note, due to time reasons, not everything is fully implemented yet. For the VAE / EEGNet, please refer to the corresponding 
notebooks found in `.notebooks/` dir.

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/negralessio/biosignals-gen-ai
   ```


2. Navigate to the project root directory by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   cd biosignals-gen-ai
   ```

3. [Optional] Create a virtual environment and activate it. For example, using the built-in `venv` module in Python:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Place the data in the `data/raw` folder.

6. Run the pipeline with the following command:

   ```
   python3 main.py --config "configs/config.yaml"
   
# Findings
Below you can find the results of our VAE on the EEGNet. 
- Populating the train set with reconstructed / synthetic data decreases the validation loss and
- also stabilizes the training, especially in the context of low samples as we have here
